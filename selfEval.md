# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

I think I've done a decent job of time management, I think above anything else the one thing I want to work on is allowing myself to feel comfortable taking breaks. Right now whenever I do take a break its around 20 minutes or less and I think it would be beneficial to push that out a little. As for where I spend the majority of time, its definitely on objects. The manipulation and changing aspect is still very strange to me.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

A function combines any number of things you want to be changed, changes them, then returns them in a more compact and pretty way.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

Parameters are like variables, but unlike basic variables these can be accessed and manipulated inside of a function, they act as a guide directing the info you want to get used in a function
Arguments are the actual data that gets passed into a function through the use of parameters, they can be any type of data that JS uses

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?

What does it look like when you start including more complex data types like arrays in you functions parameters? What aspects of a function can you use to manipulate them?
